# Heart Disease Mortality Analysis
## Introduction
This project delves into the intricate relationship between heart disease mortality rates and a multitude of behavioral, environmental, and socio-economic factors across the United States. By examining variables within our control (like exercise habits and smoking) alongside factors beyond our control (such as gender and pre-existing health conditions), we aim to uncover the multifaceted dynamics influencing cardiovascular mortalities. Our investigation is guided by pivotal questions concerning the role of gender, ethnicity, geographical clustering, and the impact of income levels on heart disease outcomes.

## Project Objectives
* To explore the correlation between gender, ethnicity, and heart-related deaths.
* To identify if there's a geographical pattern to heart-related mortalities in the US.
* To assess the relationship between income levels and cardiovascular mortality distribution.
* To determine the features most strongly correlated with heart disease mortality and their geographical clustering patterns.

## Dataset Description
Our analysis is grounded on data sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alongside other reputable databases that provide income statistics, demographic information, and health-related survey results. This dataset encompasses:

* Participant demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
* Behavioral data (exercise frequency, smoking habits)
* Environmental factors (location, income levels)
* Health outcomes (heart disease mortalities)


## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
* Cleaning: We've cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data quality.
* Integration: Data from different sources have been integrated to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Analysis Techniques
* Statistical Analysis: To understand the correlation between different variables and heart disease mortalities.
* Geographical Analysis: Utilizing GIS data to identify clustering of heart-related deaths across the US.
* Machine Learning Models: To predict heart disease mortalities based on a range of factors.

## Findings and Insights
Our preliminary analysis indicates significant insights into how demographic and socio-economic factors correlate with heart disease mortalities. Key findings include:

* The impact of gender and ethnicity on heart-related deaths.
* Geographical clusters of high mortality rates.
* Correlation between income levels and heart disease outcomes.
* Identifiable patterns in behaviors and environmental factors closely linked with cardiovascular mortalities.
